<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>If there’s one ingredient we’ll never not be excited about, it’s the incredible, edible egg. It’s not because of the rich, sunny-yellow yolks or the way the whites crisp up when you fry them in hot oil (okay, it’s partly about those things): It’s the fact that we never run out of ways to use them. Check out some of our most beloved egg recipes, all of which put these protein-packed parcels of joy in the spotlight.</p>
