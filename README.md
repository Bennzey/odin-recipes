# odin-recipes
This is my first solo web project.
I'm doing this in order to complete the The Odin Project programming guide, and be able to test and demonstrate my skills learned throughout the course so far. 
I can now create a html page, with bold and italic text, with references to other websites and web pages inside my own web site. I can also add images and ordered lists! 
I know this is only a very little fraction of what programming is, but I am very happy with my progress so far!
